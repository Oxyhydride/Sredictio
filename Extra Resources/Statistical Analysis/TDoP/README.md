# TDoP
## What does TDoP stand for?
TDoP stands for **T**raining **D**ata **o**n **P**erformance.

## What's this directory?
The TDoP directory is a subdirectory for the **Training Data on Performance** analysis found in the `Sredictio Data Tracking` spreadsheet.

In this folder contains my code to test out the types of training data used and their relative performances on the different testing data that I've set.

To see the results, you may check out `outFile.txt`. If you are intrested in how the results were obtained, check out `Training Data on Performance.py`.
