Update 1576072800
- A dumb person forget to update the `Updated on` string at the start of `Main.py`
- Changelog was updated with the Version 0.1.2 hotfix.

Update 1576072222
- Emergency hotfix for the Yahoo Stock obtainer. The yahoo-fin library didn't work, so a hotfix was needed. The `stockUtils.py` file was created as a result.
- `Main.py` was also updated to reflect this change.
- `requirements.txt` now excludes the yahoo-fin library.
- README.md no longer shows the version number.

Update 1575993696
- Added a `Changelog.txt` to document all updates to files from 2019-12-10 onwards.
- Removed `Sredictio Deployment Test.yml` and `Sredictio Training Test.yml` for being ineffective for picking out issues in code.

Update 1575992499
The Actions of `Sredictio Deployment Test.yml` and `Sredictio Training Test.yml` now will run on every branch, and not just on the "master" branch. This change will allow us to see if the code is working *before* the final pull request is made to the "master" branch.

- Added documentation to `miscUtils.py` functions so that their usage is more explicit.
