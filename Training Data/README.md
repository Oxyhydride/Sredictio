# Training Data
This directory contains all the training data that I've gathered for Sredictio.

The stock data is taken from Yahoo Finance, while the sentiment data is taken from the Straits Times' articles about a particular stock.

The training data can be updated automatically. You just need to run the `Update Training Data.py` file located in the main directory.
