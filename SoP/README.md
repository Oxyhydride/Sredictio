SDoP stands for **S**entiment **o**n **P**erformance.

## What's this directory?
The SoP directory is a subdirectory for the **Sentiment on Performance** analysis found in the `Sredictio Data Tracking` spreadsheet.

In this folder contains my code to test out the effect of sentiment data on the performance of the A2C model.

To see the results, you may check out `outFile.txt`. If you are intrested in how the results were obtained, check out `Sentiment on Performance.py`.
